NicoGrid is an EV platform that allows its users to navigate through multiple
charging networks in a single unified application. Users can search, book, and
pay for a convenient charging station without having to navigate through
multiple websites.

This project was made for the Software Testing and Quality Control course of
2025 in Universidade de Aveiro.
